**How to generate paths**

The strategy chosen for generating path was to use a spline tool for interpolating points, as suggested in the Project instructions and in the Project Q&A. 

The starting step was to use the telemetry data and get the 
car's x and y positions and the yaw angle. These values were used to calculate the first two points of the car trajectory, either using the last two points from the previous cycle or the car position and angle. 

The previous path is a list of points that the car hasn't already visited from the previous cycle. 
I decided to stick with a 50 points path, as in the project instructions, so all the remaining points from the previous cycle were added to the output list so I only had to compute and append new waypoints until the path had 50 in total. 

To generate new points, the car position in Fren√©t s coordinates was used to compute 3 anchor points in map coordinates that would be used to interpolate a spline. These 3 points would be equally distributed at 30, 60 and 90 meters in the s direction from the car's position. 
By using a provided helper function (getXY), an x and y coordinate was generated from each anchor point in map coordinates.

To make it easier to generate a path for the car, the x and y anchor points were shifted and rotated to be in car's local coordinates system. A spline was then generated from them, that would be able to associate a y value from a given x value and make them fit a desired line similar to the path the car should follow. 

To compute these points, by following the project Q&A discussion, a point in the horizon was chosen at 30 meters from the car and its corresponding y coordinate was generated from the spline (line 318). The distance of that target point from the car could be thought of as the hypotenuse of a hypothetical triangle where the opposite side is the x axis. The distance could then be calculated by using the Pythagorean problem and then split into a number of steps, each one delimited by points. 

The number of steps was calculated by dividing the target distance by the car velocity at each cycle. 
Then new path coordinates were generated and added to the points from the previous path, until the output list had a length of 50.
